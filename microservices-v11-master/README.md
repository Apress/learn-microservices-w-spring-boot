# Learn Microservices with Spring Boot - v11

This project contains the version 11 of the application that is developed under the scope of the book *Learn Microservices with Spring Boot*. You can buy the book on [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2FSB2ME) or [Apress](http://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484231647).

The book shows you how to evolve a simple Spring Boot application to become a full Microservices Architecture, using Spring Cloud Eureka, Ribbon, Zuul and Hystrix to implement Service Discovery, Load Balancing, the API Gateway pattern and a Circuit Breaker. Besides, you'll learn how to implement End-to-End tests with Cucumber, an Event-Driven system and the best practices when building Microservices.

## Idea

These projects, included in [Microservices-Practical repositories](https://github.com/microservices-practical), illustrate how to start an application from scratch and then evolve it to become a full microservices environment.

This version has exactly the same functionality as the v10 version, but the projects have been upgraded to Spring Boot 2.1, thus applying some minor changes in code to make them work.  This version is also 'dockerized,' demonstrating how to run each component in a separate Docker container.

## Contents

The repository contains six folders, one for each component of the system:

* **social-multiplication** is one of the backend services. It has a REST API to get and provide results to simple multiplications. When an attempt is sent, it triggers an *event*.
* **gamification** is the second backend service. It provides a REST API to get game stats and reacts to the event sent by the multiplication service, updating the figures.
* **service-registry** is the Eureka Server, which is contacted by backend services and the gateway.
* **gateway** is the Routing Service, implemented with Zuul. It connects with Eureka for service discovery, and performs load balancing with Ribbon.
* **ui** contains the static files of the frontend application. It's configured to be started with Jetty.
* **tests_e2e** contains the end to end test cases, developed with Cucumber (Gherkin notation)

## How to execute the application

These are the instructions:

* **UI**. Download and install [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html). From the command line, execute `java -jar [JETTY_HOME]/jetty-[VERSION]/start.jar` (replace the values between brackets accordingly). You also need Java.
* **RabbitMQ**. Download and install [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html). We use it as Event bus. When you have installed it, you need to run the RabbitMQ server (as a service or as a process, whatever you prefer).
* **Multiplication, Gamification, Service Registry and Gateway**. You need to start all these services using the command line. Navigate to each folder and execute for every one of them: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. If you want to try load balancing you can execute more than one instance of the Multiplication or Gamification service. To do that, override the port number to avoid clashing: `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="--server.port=A_FREE_PORT]"`

## Docker Containers ##

Assuming you have docker and docker-compose installed, go to the project top level directory and execute: `docker-compose up`.  This will launch the following containers:

* rabbitmq
* service-registry
* gateway
* social-multiplication
* gamification

Launch the UI (as noted above).
