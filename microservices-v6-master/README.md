# microservices-v6

This project contains the version 6 of the application that is developed under the scope of the book *Learn Microservices with Spring Boot*. You can get a copy of the book on [Apress](http://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484231647).

## About this version

This version contains three projects: 
* **gamification** and **social-multiplication** are our microservices already created in previous versions. 
* **ui** contains the web pages and javascript of our application, now separated to a new, independently deployable component.

This version also includes an update of the UI to look nicer using Bootstrap.
