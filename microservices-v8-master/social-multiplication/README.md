## About this version

This version contains four projects: 
* **gamification** and **social-multiplication** are our microservices already created and evolved in previous versions. 
* **ui** contains the web pages and javascript of our application, within an independently deployable component.
* **gateway** contains the Spring Boot Application that models the API Gateway in our system, using Zuul.
* **service-registry** contains the Eureka Registry Server, which is used now by the different microservices and the gateway.
