# microservices-v3

This project contains the third version of the application that is developed under the scope of the book *Learn Microservices with Spring Boot*. You can get a copy of the book on [Apress](http://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484231647).

## About this version

This is the first version in which we have a working social-multiplication application. 
You can play with it by running the Spring Boot application and navigating with your browser to 
`http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

Our social-multiplication application follows now a 3 layered design, and contains unit tests for the *service* and
*controller* layers.
